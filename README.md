Currently building a deep (or shallow if I find performance is better) neural network to predict sports outcomes.

Currently only doing NBA, but might do more sports in the future.

Goal is to predict game and player outcomes.

ex:
who wins: pacers vs thunder
how likely is this to happen: lebron scoring over 20 points
who will have more assists when playing each other: wemby vs chet
etc
